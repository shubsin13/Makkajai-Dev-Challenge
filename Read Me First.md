solution2.cpp is my solution to solution for the 2nd problem.
My approach is to interate through all of the alive cells, check if they will survive for next gen, and if they do then add them in a new list which stores cells which will be alive for the next gen. And for the dead cells which are to come alive. I will go throught every alive cells and then to their 8 possible dead neighbours, and add them to a new list in which stores dead cells which need to be checked if they will become alive or not, and if they do then add them to the list storing alive cells in next gen.
Here actions I will be doing most are iterating thorugh every elements in a list. Then checking dead or alive condition of their 8 possible neighbours. A has map is a best choice for this, because iterating thought takes O(n) time, and accessing possible neighbouring points will take O(1) time.
Total time complexity of my solution is O(n), since I will be adding all new cells' coordinates into a hashset. Then another interation finding which among alive cells will survive. Then another iteration finding which are the possible neighbouring dead cells whi have a possiblity of becoming alive. Then iterating through all of them checking whcih one of them will turn alive and them adding them to the list of cells who will be alive in next gen.
Total space comlexity of the solution is O(n) since I will be needing 3 lists.
